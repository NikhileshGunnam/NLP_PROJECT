Project Title: Sentiment Analysis on the Syrian-CivilWar Conflict using Reddit Data

The source code files are kaggle notebook files, most of the installations will be carried out during execution. I used Kaggle to run and code the project.

The code files were named as follows: 1) reddit-api-script.ipynb which is the source code to extract data using reddit API 2) sentiment-analysis-on-Syrian-CivilWar-reddit.ipynb -> This is the source code, where we import and do sentiment analysis on the data. The notebook contains all the results and these were documented in the report as well. 

Execution: 1)Import the above files 2)Give the dataset path to the sentiment-analysis-on-Syrian-CivilWar-reddit.ipynb, and start running the cells 3)The data can be freshly extracted using API script or you can use the data source file present in the submission.

These codes were also available online in Kaggle in the following links:
