Project Title: Sentiment Analysis on the Syrian-CivilWar Conflict using Reddit Data

The majority of the setup will be completed while the code is being executed; the source code files are Kaggle notebook files. To run and code the project, I utilized Kaggle.

The following is the name of the code files: 1) Reddit-api-script.ipynb, the source code for the Reddit API data extraction 2) sentiment-analysis-on-reddit.ipynb/Syrian-CivilWar -> This is the source code that we import the data into to do sentiment analysis. All of the results are in the notebook, and the report also includes documentation of them.

First, import the aforementioned files. Second, Start the cells by providing the sentiment-analysis-on-Syrian-CivilWar-reddit.ipynb dataset URL. Third, the data source file included in the submission can be used, or you can use an API script to extract the data directly.
